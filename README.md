# Notes-Locker

Notes Locker is a simple decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to store private encrypted notes on the blockchain.  
Users connect their **MetaMask** wallet, enter an encrypted note, and save it permanently to the smart contract. The stored notes are then fetched and displayed under **"Your Notes"**.

This project serves as an introductory example for learning Ethereum, MetaMask interaction, and Web3-based front-end development.
